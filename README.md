# SciGraph  

## **Development of a Methodology and Program for Creating a Dataset to Train Neural Networks to Integrate Scientific Graphics**  

### **Scientific Graphics Dataset Extraction from PDFs**  

## **Project Description**  
This project focuses on developing a methodology and software for the automated creation of a dataset containing scientific graphics (e.g., graphs and charts) extracted from PDF documents. The dataset is designed for training neural networks, which can be used for automatic analysis and recognition of scientific graphs.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Image Extraction:** Automatic parsing of PDF documents and extraction of images related to scientific graphics.  
- **Filtering and Classification:** Selection of relevant images and filtering out non-graphical elements (e.g., logos, schematics).  
- **Data Annotation:** Generation of annotations (metadata) for further use in training neural networks.  
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Ability to adapt the methodology for different types of scientific articles and publications.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python, OpenCV, PyMuPDF** (for working with PDFs)  
- **Machine Learning/Deep Learning** (for potential automated image classification)  
- **JSON/XML** (for metadata storage)  

This project is being developed as part of a graduation thesis and is aimed at researchers, scientific data processing specialists, and AI developers.
